Recall (from a discrete math course, probably) the principle of induction over natural numbers: If P(n) is some proposition involving a natural number n and we want to show that P holds for all numbers n, we can reason like this:
show that P(O) holds;
show that, for any n', if P(n') holds, then so does P(S n');
conclude that P(n) holds for all n.

Corresponding informal proof 
Theorem: For any n, m and p,
      n + (m + p) = (n + m) + p.
Proof: By induction on n.
First, suppose n = 0. We must show that
        0 + (m + p) = (0 + m) + p.
This follows directly from the definition of +.
Next, suppose n = S n', where
        n' + (m + p) = (n' + m) + p.
We must now show that
        (S n') + (m + p) = ((S n') + m) + p.
By the definition of +, this follows from
        S (n' + (m + p)) = S ((n' + m) + p),
which is immediate from the induction hypothesis. Qed.

(* Exercise: add_comm_informal *)
(* 
Theorem: Addition is commutative.
Proof: 
Suppose for any n and m,
      n + m = m + n
By induction on n.
First, suppose n = 0. We must show that
        0 + m = m + 0.
This follows directly from the definition of +.
Next, suppose n = S n', where
        n' + m = m + n'
We must now show that
        S n' + m = m + S n'.
By the definition of +, this follows from
        S (n' + m) = S (m + n'),
which is immediate from the induction hypothesis. Qed.

Theorem: (n =? n) = true for any n.
Proof: 
By induction on n.
First, suppose n = 0. We must show that
        (0 =? 0) = true
This follows directly which follows directy from the definition of =?.
Next, suppose n = S n', where

We must now show that
