Compute (next_working_day friday).
(* simplify as much as possible *)

Example test_next_working_day:
  (next_working_day (next_working_day saturday)) = tuesday.
(* Example/Theorem/Lemma/Proposition takes you to proof mode *)

Proof. simpl. reflexivity. Qed.
(* 
- simpl reduces a goal as much as possible 
- reflexivity is particular to equality proofs if generates no subgoal if the left and right hand side is indeed the same
- Qed takes you back from proving mode back to the top level
 *)

Print test_next_working_day.
(* prove in just two steps: eq_refl? is the proof object + defines equality in coq *)

(* conditional expression but with one generalization: 
The guard is considered true if it evaluates to the "constructor" of the first clause of the Inductive definition *)

(* functions are also values with their own type depending on their inputs and output*)
